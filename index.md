# Ysatis Tagle — Embedded Systems Developer

Hey! I’m Ysatis an embedded systems enthusiast who loves designing systems that bridge hardware and software.
I focus on custom PCB design, microcontroller firmware, and real-world signal processing.

When I’m not debugging circuits, I’m usually making things: screenprinting, building DIY guitar pedals, sewing, laser cutting, 3D printing, restoring retro tech, or playing music. I enjoy tackling projects end-to-end: from soldering hardware to writing bare-metal firmware and building PC tools that make it all work together.

## Featured Projects *(In Progress)*

These projects are **works in progress**. I’m actively developing, testing, and documenting them to grow my embedded systems skills and demonstrate real-world problem solving and to fix problems.

### Analog Video to UART Converter *(In Progress)*

**Overview:**
A custom embedded system that converts analog CVBS video to a digital stream over UART using an STM32F microcontroller and a video decoder.

**Goals:**  
- Design and fabricate a custom PCB for the STM32F + video decoder IC
- Write bare-metal firmware in C to handle I2C configuration, video data buffering, and UART streaming  
- Verify data integrity with a logic analyzer and oscilloscope  
- Optimize for real-time performance and low-level register programming
- Free up some tapes from my camcorder!

### PC UART Video Receiver & Visualizer *(In Progress)*

**Overview:**
A companion Python tool that will receive the video stream over UART and display it in real-time on a PC.

**Goals:**
- Build a Python script for cross-platform serial communication and frame rendering
- Reconstruct and display video frames from the incoming UART stream
- Log frame stats for testing and debugging

**Repo:** TBD

## Previous School Projects

Below are a few selected projects I completed during my academic career that each helped me build a strong foundation in the engineering design process and professional skills.

### Whack-a-Mole Game on BeagleBone Black

TBD `![School Project Photo](/assets/images/project-1.jpg)`

Implemented a Whack-a-Mole game on the BeagleBone Black to learn driver development and embedded graphics. Wrote a custom frame buffer driver, designed a Qt interface for the display, and built the game logic in C++ using a state machine with software debouncing. The game supported a timer and multiple difficulty levels. An improvement to this project would be to add a global leaderboard.

### Sorption-Based Gas Recycling & Exhaust System (Capstone)

TBD `![School Project Photo](/assets/images/project-2.jpg)`

Capstone project to design a modular gas recycling and exhaust system using sorption. Led team research on chemical engineering methods, realistic use cases, and prototype feasibility. Built a test bench with an Arduino, calibrated analog pressure and gas composition sensors, and wrote a Python script to capture live data and export it for analysis. Gained hands-on experience managing a team, planning with Gantt charts, and documenting the engineering design process.
